# PlanetHouseEscape
This is my project for the Programming in C# course at UK MFF.

I made the visual assets by combining Unity's primitive geometric shapes.

To download the game, visit this page: https://bigsnack.itch.io/planet-house-escape

For the auto-generated documentation (such as doxygen), the source code directory is: \PlanetHouseEscape\Assets\Scripts

The main page for the documentation is taken from DocumentationMainPage.md.
