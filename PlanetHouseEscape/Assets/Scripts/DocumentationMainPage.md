\section goals Goal of the Game

Your goal is to escape the house. The key is inside the glass/blue rectangle ("planetarium") in the hall. To acquire the key (red colored), you must find and insert all eight planets into the aquarium. After inserting the planets, the key will drop. You must carry the key to the door (with the red handle) and it will automatically be opened.

Good luck.

- Most planets can be found hidden behind objects in the house. Try exploring.
- The "pool of planets" in the cellar (which is inside the kitchen), contains many decoy planets, and one unique planet.
- Try turning off the lights in the bedroom.
- The letter eating machine is hungry for the 80th chemical element.
- The "parkour room" contains a planet which is too far out of reach. Try picking up and rotating the logs below the room to get across.
